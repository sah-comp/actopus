Cinnebar is a leightweight no-framework framework written in PHP by Stephan Hombergs.

I started this a few years ago as a learning project and the code-base has evolved
throughtout the years. By now it has matured to something i use on a regular basis
to quickly build sites and web applications. It is just another framework, but it
is mine. Just kidding.

Maybe it is useful to someone else, so i put it up into the open source world.

- Have fun
- Keep it simple, stupid
- Do not repeat yourself
- Assume nothing
- Convention over configuration
- Don't call us, we'll call you
- Beware of automation
- Refactor on green
- Read, write and refine documentation often
- Find someone to proof-read all you have written yourself
- Do not follow rules!

Sincerly,
